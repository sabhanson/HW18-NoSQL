# NoSQL - Social Network API [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description
I built this Social Network API using the [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment), and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages to connect to a MongoDB database.  
It is especially useful for a social media application to organize their `Users` and `Thoughts`, as well as allow for users to have `Friends` and leave `Reactions` on fellow users' thoughts.  
It's quick and easy to follow the API routes to `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete` data.
